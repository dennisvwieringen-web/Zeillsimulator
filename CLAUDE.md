\# Claude Code Guidelines



\## Working Agreement / House Rules

1\.  \*\*Autonomy:\*\* You are authorized to apply code changes automatically without asking for confirmation for every single edit.

2\.  \*\*Flow:\*\* Work continuously through a task until completion. Only stop to update if a major architectural choice or high-impact decision is needed.

3\.  \*\*Context:\*\* We are building a sailing simulator based on specific Dutch sailing theory ("Het Zeilboek").

4\.  \*\*Language:\*\* Code comments in English, user-facing text in Dutch.



\## Project Style

\* \*\*Simplicity:\*\* Use Vanilla JS and HTML5 Canvas. No external frameworks (like Phaser) unless absolutely necessary for performance.

\* \*\*Code Structure:\*\* Keep logic separated: `Physics`, `Renderer`, `Input`, `GameLoop`.
